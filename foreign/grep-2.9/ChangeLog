2011-06-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	version 2.9
	* NEWS: Record release date.

	build: avoid a warning when building with --disable-perl-regexp...
	and --enable-gcc-warnings.
	* src/pcresearch.c (WITHOUT_PCRE_NORETURN): Define.
	Remove the unreachable return statement.
	Reported by Eric Blake.

	tests: ensure that each test script is executable
	This adds a rule run at "make check" time to ensure that
	test scripts are consistently executable.
	This change is not required for "make check", but makes it easier
	for people to run scripts manually, but that is discouraged because
	doing so makes it easy to omit important variable settings that
	are normally provided via TESTS_ENVIRONMENT.
	This change also makes each of the existing TESTS executable.
	* tests/Makefile.am (check_executable_TESTS): New rule.
	(check): Depend on it.
	* tests/{all_scripts}: chmod 755.
	Prompted by a report from Eric Blake.

	maint: update bootstrap from gnulib
	* bootstrap: Update from gnulib.

	maint: update po/POTFILES.in
	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove dfasearch.c, now that it no longer
	contains a translatable diagnostic.

	tests: include-exclude: avoid false positive failure on FreeBSD
	* tests/include-exclude: Avoid false-positive failure due to
	matching "a" in a directory on FreeBSD, when searching a directory
	without "-r".  Search for '^aaa$' rather than just 'a'.
	Adjust test inputs and expected output files accordingly.

	dfa: remove some useless casts
	* src/dfa.c (icatalloc): Change type of "old" parameter
	from "char const *" to "char *".
	Don't cast-away const on realloc argument.
	Remove now-unnecessary const-discarding cast.
	Don't (void)-cast strcpy result.
	* src/dosbuf.c (undossify_input): Remove anachronistic
	cast-to-"char *" of realloc argument.

	dfa: more heap-allocation-related overflow protection
	* src/dfa.c (enlist): Use xnrealloc, not realloc.
	Also, remove unnecessary cast-to-(char *).
	(dfamust): Use xnmalloc, not malloc.  Before, this code would
	return upon malloc failure (xnmalloc exits upon failure), but
	later, via the *ALLOC macros, it could already exit, so this
	new potential exit point is nothing new.  The same applies
	to enlist, since it is called only through dfamust.

	tests: update init.sh; simplify TESTS_ENVIRONMENT
	* tests/init.sh: Update from coreutils.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Remove shell_or_perl_
	function.  Instead, just use $(SHELL), since grep has no test
	that starts with #!/usr/bin/perl.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	build: avoid configure/gnulib-related errors
	* bootstrap.conf: Remove now-unnecessary code to exclude
	gettext/intl-related m4 tests.

2011-06-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: tighten up superfluous code
	* src/main.c (parse_grep_colors): Use xstrdup in place of xmalloc,
	a useless test, strlen, and strcpy.

2011-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	dfa: avoid possibility of overflow
	* src/dfa.c (REALLOC_IF_NECESSARY, CALLOC, MALLOC, REALLOC):
	Use functions from xalloc.h to avoid overflow.
	* src/dfasearch.c (GEAcompile): Use xnrealloc rather than realloc.
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pcompile): Use xnmalloc, not xmalloc.

2011-06-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest

	dfa: correct two uses of btowc
	* src/dfa.c (setbit_c, setbit_case_fold_c): Compare the btowc
	return value against WEOF, not EOF.  Suggested by Eli Zaretskii.
	On a system like MinGW with unsigned wint_t, comparing a btowc
	return value against EOF (-1) would always be false.

2011-06-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: don't overrun a malloc'd buffer for certain regexps
	* src/dfa.c (dfaanalyze): Allocate space for twice as many
	positions as there are leaves.  Before this change, for some
	regular expressions, DFA analysis would have inserted far more
	"positions" than dfa->nleaves (up to double).
	Reported by Raymond Russell in http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?33547
	* tests/dfa-heap-overrun: Trigger the overrun.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

2011-06-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: don't ignore sjis-mb test failure
	I made changes that caused grep to segfault during "make check" --
	as seen in dmesg output -- yet no test failed(!), and there was no
	trace of the segfault in the logs.
	* tests/sjis-mb (test_grep_reject): Ensure that output is empty.
	Don't ignore test failure.

2011-06-07  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: optimize wide characters in a bracket expression
	* src/dfa.c (addtok): Compile characters to an alternation.  Handle the
	case when nothing else remains in the MBCSET.

	dfa: refactor to prepare for upcoming optimizations
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): Move optimization of MBCSET from here...
	(addtok): ... to here.

	dfa: correct handling of single-byte character ranges
	This provides a better fix for the unibyte-bracket-expr and high-bit-range
	testcases, and fixes the latent bug tested by bogus-wctob.

	* src/dfa.c (setbit_case_fold): Remove, replace with...
	(setbit_wc, setbit_c, setbit_case_fold_c): ... these.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Use setbit_case_fold_c when iterating over
	single-byte sequences.  Use setbit_wc for multi-byte character sets,
	and setbit_case_fold_c for single-byte character sets.
	(lex): Use setbit_case_fold_c for single-byte character sets.

	tests: exercise latent bug in character ranges
	* tests/bogus-wctob: New.
	* Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	like the one mentioned in the original report: see 2011-05-07
	commit d98338eb.  Re-reported by Santiago Ruano Rincón.
	Note that most uni-byte locales are not affected.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	tests: use skip_test_, not skip_
	Use skip_test_, not skip_.  The former prints its message both to
	the log file and to FD 9 (redirected to tty via tests/Makefile.am),
	while skip_ prints only to stderr, which goes to the log file.
	* tests/init.cfg (skip_test_): New function.
	Use skip_test_ in place of skip_ everywhere.
	* tests/fmbtest: s/skip_/skip_test_/
	* tests/sjis-mb: Likewise.

	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Drop strtoul, rename wctype to
	wctype-h.

2011-05-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	grep -P: don't abort upon exceeding PCRE's backtracking limit
	* src/pcresearch.c (Pexecute): Handle PCRE_ERROR_MATCHLIMIT.
	* tests/Makefile.am (XFAIL_TESTS): Remove pcre-abort.
	* tests/pcre-abort: Expect failure, no output, and increase
	the length of the input string, in case the backtracking limit
	is ever raised.  Adjust comment.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

	tests: show how to make grep -P abort
	* tests/pcre-abort: New file.
	Minimal testcase by Paolo Bonzini, derived from a report
	by www.beaver@list.ru.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	(XFAIL_TESTS): Add it here, too, since this test always fails, for now.

	tests: fix oddities in pcre-z
	* tests/pcre-z: Redirect stderr inside $(), not outside.
	Remove double quotes around $REGEX (which is just 'a') within
	double-quoted "$(...)".  Split a long line.

	tests: factor out a new require_pcre_ function
	* tests/init.cfg (require_pcre_): New function, factored out of...
	* tests/pcre-z: ...here.  Use the function.
	* tests/pcre: Likewise.

	tests: clean up pcre
	* tests/pcre: Skip (don't pass) the test when PCRE support is disabled.
	Don't redirect so much to /dev/null, now that all test output goes to
	pcre.log.  Remove unnecessary braces and diagnostic about failing test.

2011-05-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: use consistent declaration syntax

	when wctob returns EOF.
	* NEWS (Bug fixes): Mention it.

2011-05-02  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	doc: correct comment about mmap
	* doc/grep.texi (Other Options) [--mmap]: This option is now

	* src/dfa.c (check_matching_with_multibyte_ops, dfastate): As above.

2011-03-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: stop using .x-sc_* files to list syntax-check exemptions
	Instead, use the new mechanism with which you merely use a
	variable (derived from the rule name) defined in cfg.mk to an ERE
	matching the exempted file names.

	build: update gnulib to latest

	tests: don't hard-code a 5-second timeout; that's not always enough

	it in the UTF-8 locale.
	* tests/backref-multibyte-slow: Compute a performance-relative timeout.
	Reported by Gilles Espinasse, regarding an imac 400.  For more details,

2010-09-23  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	tests: add testcase for previous fix
	* tests/inconsistent-ranges: New.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	dfa: process range expressions consistently with system regex
	The actual meaning of range expressions in glibc is not exactly strcoll,
	which makes the behavior of grep hard to predict when compiled with the
	system regex.  Leave to the system regex matcher the decision of which
	single-byte characters are matched by a range expression.

	This partially reverts a change made in commit 0d38a8bb (which made
	sense at the time, but not now that src/dfa.c is not doing multibyte
	character set matching anymore).

	* src/dfa.c (in_coll_range): Remove.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Use system regex to find which single-char
	bytes match a range expression.

2010-09-23  Bruno Haible  <bruno@clisp.org>

	build: fix link error on systems that have libiconv but not libintl
	* src/Makefile.am (LDADD): Add $(LIBICONV).

	* src/dfasearch.c (dfawarn): Rename enum symbols to use DW_ prefix,
	so as not to collide with "GNU", which is defined by the Hurd.
	Reported by Matthias Lanzinger in http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?31096

	maint: avoid obsolete gnulib modules
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Don't use obsolete atexit module.
	Use malloc-gnu and realloc-gnu -- malloc and realloc are obsolete.

2010-09-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	* tests/equiv-classes: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	(XFAIL_TESTS) [USE_INCLUDED_REGEX]: Mark it as expected failure.

	dfa: fall back to glibc matcher if a MBCSET is found
	This patch enables full support of equivalence classes and multicharacter
	collation symbols.  It can also improve performance problems in some
	cases for multibyte grep.  Both of these changes however depend on the
	glibc version installed in the system.

	For UTF-8 it will trigger only in the presence of MBCSET, e.g. [a-z].
	For other character sets all brackets and `.` as well will trigger it.

	* NEWS: Document this.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Fall back to glibc for multibyte matches,
	if possible.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	This is done to include commit "regex: Pass the system regex if its only
	problem is 32-bit regoff_t".

	regular expression as a set of just 6 bytes.  And I certainly don't
	want grep to silently do the wrong thing, even if that would be
	officially standards-conforming.  It's obvious that I intended
	[[:lower:]], and I want my error to be diagnosed in a way that is
	most likely to get my attention.  Thus, with this change, grep now
	prints a diagnostic and exits with status 2 the moment it
	encounters an offending [:char_class:] construct.

	This changes the way grep works by default, rather than
	putting this new behavior on an option.  A new option
	would seldom be used in scripts (not portable), and would
	probably be used only rarely by those who need it the most.
	This new functionality provides a valuable safety measure
	and incurs truly negligible risk.

	For strict POSIX compliance, set POSIXLY_CORRECT in
	your environment.  That disables this new feature.

	Revert the changes from commit 2cd3bcea, "grep: add
	--warnings={always,never,auto}.", and then do the following:

	* src/dfasearch.c (dfawarn): Call getenv("POSIXLY_CORRECT") here;
	Remove "warning: " from the diagnostic, now that it's more than
	a warning, and exit with status 2.
	* NEWS (New features): Describe the new semantics.
	* tests/warn-char-classes: Adjust one test to accommodate this change.
	* doc/grep.texi (Character Classes and Bracket Expressions): Document.
	(Environment Variables): Cross-reference it.
	Remove reference to obsolete getopt illegal vs. invalid difference.
	Thanks to Paul Eggert for suggestions and an initial prod.

	Commit db9d6 would erroneously skip matches in SJIS character sets.  In

	grep -F: avoid infinite loop when searching for incomplete MB character
	Searching for an incomplete non-prefix of a multi-byte character

	    printf '\357\274\241\n' | perl -CIO -ne '/\274/ and print'

	  These should also print nothing, but with grep-2.6 and grep-2.6.1,
	  they would infloop:

2010-03-22  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	grep: remove --mmap
	mmap is a bad idea for sequentially accessed file because it will cause
	a page fault for every read page.  Just consider it a failed experiment,

2010-03-21  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: use the fcntl-h module, not "fcntl"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): We might need fcntl.h somewhere,
	but don't use the fcntl function.  Reported by Bruno Haible.

	build: avoid link failure on systems using gnulib's fcntl but not open
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Using gnulib's fcntl module
	and including <fcntl.h>, but not also using gnulib's "open" module
	would result in link failure due to references to rpl_open
	on systems requiring the replacement (e.g., Cygwin and Darwin).

	build: avoid compilation failure on systems using rpl_open
	This new build failure has arisen as a result of using gnulib's
	"fcntl" module.  Now that an inadequate "open" syscall is replace
	by gnulib's wrapper, it is essential to include <fcntl.h>.
	* src/grep.c: Include <fcntl.h>.
	This is required, for grepfile's use of open, at least on
	Cygwin and Darwin.

	maint: use gnulib's fcntl module, just in case
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add fcntl.
	Grep uses at least O_BINARY, which may be defined therein.

	maint: remove TYPE_* definitions from src/system.h
	* src/system.h (TYPE_MAXIMUM, TYPE_MINIMUM, TYPE_SIGNED): Remove
	definitions.  They are provided by intprops.h.
	* src/grep.c: Include "intprops.h"
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add intprops.

	maint: alphabetize #include directives
	* src/grep.c: Alphabetize #include directives.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: stop using gnulib's memmove module
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Remove obsolete module: memmove

	build: reinstate gnulib's fcntl-h-tests
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Do not avoid
	the fcntl-h-tests.  I cannot reproduce the failure.

2010-03-20  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	build: allow compilation on cygwin
	Gnulib is incompatible with -Wunused-macros.  Addtionally,
	cygwin 1.7.1 coupled with --enable-gcc-warnings tripped on:

	grep.c: In function 'print_line_middle':
	grep.c:805: error: array subscript has type 'char' [-Wchar-subscripts]
	grep.c: In function 'main':
	grep.c:1833: error: 'optarg' redeclared without dllimport attribute: previous dllimport ignored [-Wattributes]
	grep.c:1834: error: 'optind' redeclared without dllimport attribute after being referenced with dll linkage

	* configure.ac (GNULIB_WARN_FLAGS): Disable -Wunused-macros.
	* src/grep.c (print_line_middle): Use correct type to tolower.
	(main): Drop useless redeclarations.
	* .gitignore: Ignore more built files.

2010-03-20  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: ensure that all programs handle [b-a] consistently
	* tests/reversed-range-endpoints: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	build: update gnulib submodule to latest
	This pulls in the latest regex module from gnulib, including a fix
	to make it honor the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES syntax bit.

	tests: temporarily disable irrelevant-to-grep failing C++ fcntl-h-tests
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_tool_option_extras): Temporarily add
	--avoid=fcntl-h-tests, until the C++ part of that test is fixed.

	reject reversed-endpoint ranges, with all regex variants
	* src/search.c: Add RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES to the syntax bits
	in three places, so that all of grep, egrep, and grep -E reject
	a range with reversed endpoints like '[b-a]'.  This is required,
	when using the latest version of gnulib's regex module, since it
	now honors the RE_NO_EMPTY_RANGES flag, rather than acting as if
	it were always set.
	Based on a change by Matthew Burgess.

2010-03-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: correct macro parameter parentheses
	* src/dfa.c (FETCH_WC, FETCH): Parenthesize macro parameters.

2010-03-19  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	tests: change help-version to per-program functions
	* help-version: Change each *_args variable to a *_setup function.

	dfa: fix wchar_t/wint_t type mismatch
	* src/dfa.c (FETCH_WC): Pass a local wchar_t variable to mbrtowc.
	(FETCH): Rename temporary second argument to FETCH_WC.
	(parse_bracket_exp): Always use FETCH_WC.

2010-03-19  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: add README-prereq, referenced from README-hacking
	* README-prereq: New file.  Cloned from coreutils, s/coreutils/grep/
	Reported by Tony Abou-Assaleh.

2010-03-19  Arnold Robbins  <arnold@skeeve.com>

	maint: sync dfa comments from gawk
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa) [newlines]: Amend comment.
	* src/dfa.c: Update copyright year list to include gawk's.

2010-03-17  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: remove obsolete "cvs-clean" make target
	* Makefile.am (cvs-clean): Remove obsolete target.

2010-03-17  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: initialize struct mbcset using memset
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): Use memset to initialize workmbc.

	dfa: spell out "unsigned int"
	* dfa.c (setbit, tstbit, clrbit, setbit_case_fold, lex, dfaoptimize,
	free_mbdata): Put "int" after unsigned.
	* dfa.h (struct position, struct dfa): Likewise.

	dfa: optimize simple character sets under UTF-8 charsets
	Only use a bitset when possible without involving MBCSET.  Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 51ms (best of three runs); after: 16ms(best of three runs).

	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp): For simple bracket expressions
	under UTF-8, use a CSET.

	dfa: speed up handling of brackets
	This patch has two sides.  One is to fold the parsing of brackets in the
	single- and multi-byte cases.  The second is to leverage this change,
	and use a bitset to test for single-byte characters in the charset.
	Splitting the two would be very hard.

	Testcase:
	   yes 'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog' | sed 100000q | \
	     time grep -c [ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,]

	Before: 59ms (best of three runs); after: 51ms (best of three runs).
	Nice, but mostly providing infrastructure for the next patch.

	* src/dfa.c (setbit_case_fold): Try applying towlower/towupper.
	(looking_at): Remove.
	(FETCH_WC): New.
	(fetch_wc): Merge into FETCH_WC [MBS_SUPPORT].
	(FETCH) [MBS_SUPPORT]: Call FETCH_WC.
	(prednames, find_pred, is_blank and other predicates): Move above,
	remove K&R syntax support.
	(parse_bracket_exp): New name of parse_bracket_exp_mb, rewritten to
	include single-byte character set parsing of brackets.
	(lex): Adjust for fetch_wc->FETCH_WC change, remove single-byte
	character set parsing of brackets.
	(match_mb_charset): Test against work_mbc->cset.
	* src/dfa.h (struct mb_char_classes): Add cset.

	syntax-check: remove space-tab exception
	* .x-sc_space_tab: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c: Fix space-tab occurrence.

	THANKS: fix Jim Meyering's email address
	* THANKS: Jim is now with Red Hat.

	dfa: add missing function
	* src/dfa.c (using_utf8): New.
	(addtok_wc, free_mbdata, dfaoptimize) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not define.
	(dfacomp) [!MBS_SUPPORT]: Do not call dfaoptimize.

	tests: fix typo
	* fedora: Fix typo.

	tests: use Exit
	* euc-mb: exit with "Exit 0".

	grep: remove more register keywords
	* dosbuf.c: Remove register keywords.
	* grep.c: Remove register keywords.
	* kwset.c: Remove register keywords.
	* search.c: Remove register keywords.

	dfa: run simple UTF-8 regexps as a single-byte character set
	This provides a speedup whenever fgrep is "almost" sufficient but
	not quite (e.g. grep ^abc).  This affects test cases such as
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117, which are already worked around
	by the line-by-line matching patch c32c04; without that patch the
	speedup can reach 1000x even on non-contrived testcases.

	* src/dfa.c (dfaoptimize): New.
	(dfacomp): Call it.

	tests: fix syntax-check failures
	* tests/case-fold-backref: Use "foo" instead of "the".
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Remove trailing blanks.

	grep: remove check_multibyte_string, fix non-UTF8 missed match
	Avoid computing ahead something that can be computed lazily as efficiently
	(or more efficiently in the case of UTF-8, though this is left as TODO).
	At the same time, "soften" the rejection condition for matching in the
	middle of a multibyte sequence to fix bug 23814.

	Multibyte "grep -i" would still be very slow if it wasn't for the workaround
	patch c32c042 (grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i,
	2010-03-08).

	* NEWS: Document bugfix.
	* src/search.c (check_multibyte_string): Rewrite as...
	(is_mb_middle): ... this.
	(EGexecute, Fexecute): Adjust.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add euc-mb.
	* tests/euc-mb: New testcase.

	dfa: cache MB_CUR_MAX for dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (state_index, dfaexec): Use d->mb_cur_max.
	(dfainit): Initialize it.
	(free_mbdata): New, extracted out of dfafree.
	(dfafree): Use it.

	dfa: improve documentation of struct dfa
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): Reword some comments.

	tests: factor name of output files into a variable
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type,
	tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Use a variable for the output filename,
	as it is common to the grep and compare invocations.

	tests: use different output files to simplify reading failed .log files
	* tests/case-fold-backref, tests/case-fold-char-class,
	tests/case-fold-char-range, tests/case-fold-char-type: Use a different
	name for each output file from grep.
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: Likewise, and merge some grep invocations.

	tests: add another grep -i testcase, from bug 16179
	* tests/case-fold-backref: New.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.

	dfa: rewrite handling of multibyte case_fold lexing
	Let dfacomp do the folding to lowercase of multibyte input strings,
	and remove it from grep.c.  Input strings to kwset.c are still folded
	outside kwset.c, so we still need to do mbtolower in search.c.

	* NEWS: Document bugfixes.
	* .x-sc_cast_of_argument_to_free: Remove.
	* src/dfa.c (wctok, addtok_wc): New.
	(cur_mb_index, update_mb_len_index): Remove.
	(FETCH): Do not call it.
	(parse_bracket_exp_mb) [GREP]: Disable case-folding of ranges and
	characters.
	(addtok): Extract part to...
	(addtok_mb): ... this new function.
	(lex): Call fetch_wc in the main loop for MB_CUR_MAX > 1.  Return WCHAR
	for normal characters if MB_CUR_MAX > 1.
	(atom): Handle WCHAR instead of treating multibyte characters specially.
	Do case folding of multibyte characters here.
	(dfacomp): Remove case_fold special casing.
	* src/dfa.h (WCHAR): New.
	* src/grep.c (mb_icase_keys): Remove.
	(main): Do not call it.
	* src/search.c (kwsinit): Init transition table only for MB_CUR_MAX == 1.
	(mbtolower): New.
	(kwsincr_case): New.
	(kwsmusts): Call it instead of kwsincr.
	(check_multibyte_string): Remove.
	(check_multibyte_string_no_icase): Rename to check_multibyte_string.
	(GEAcompile, EGexecute, Fcompile): Use mbtolower instead of the old
	check_multibyte_string.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add case-fold-backslash-w.
	* tests/foad1.sh: Enable fixed tests.
	* tests/case-fold-backslash-w: New.

2010-03-16  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	grep: match multibyte charsets line-by-line when using -i
	The turtle combination -i + MB_CUR_MAX>1 requires case conversion ahead
	of time.  Avoid doing this repeatedly when many matches succeed.  Together
	with the previous changes, this fixes https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?29117
	and https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?14472.

	* NEWS: Document new speedup.
	* src/grep.c (do_execute): New.
	(grepbuf): Use it.

2010-03-15  Paolo Bonzini  <bonzini@gnu.org>

	dfa: fix handling of ranges in multibyte character sets
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Add separate ranges for
	lowercase and uppercase endpoints if folding case.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add case-fold-char-range.
	* tests/case-fold-char-range: New.

	tests: add more UTF-8 test cases
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add spencer1-locale.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add spencer1-locale.awk.
	* tests/spencer1-locale.awk: New.
	* tests/spencer1-locale: New.

2010-03-15  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: complete the renaming fedora.sh -> fedora
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Rename fedora.sh -> fedora here, too.

	* tests/fedora.sh: Rename to...
	* tests/fedora: ...this, to reflect new convention:
	Use the lack of a suffix to indicate we've converted to the new
	init.sh-using test framework.

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably

	tests: adjust fedora.sh to handle traps more portably
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "Exit", not "exit".

	tests: for each test, set an envvar to its name
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS_ENVIRONMENT): Set GREP_TEST_NAME for
	each test.  This is used to help make the output of hundreds of
	independent, often-parallel valgrind runs more manageable.

2010-03-14  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: clean up fedora.sh
	* tests/fedora.sh: Use "grep", not ${GREP}.
	Use init.sh.
	Use timeout 10, not sleep 1 (three times).
	The latter would always sleep for 3 seconds, and the test would
	fail with a false positive on a slow system or with a heavily
	instrumented (valgrind) executable.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: avoid build failure with --enable-gcc-warnings

	(freelist): Call free instead of ifree.
	* src/dfa.h (ptr_t): Remove.

	dfa: remove CRANGE dead code
	The only use of CRANGE was removed by commit 193830d.  In theory it is
	more correct to do what CRANGE did, but in practice it seems like it did
	not work.

	* src/dfa.h (token): Remove CRANGE.
	* src/dfa.c (atom): Do not handle CRANGE.
	(prtok): Likewise.

	dfa: get rid of x*alloc
	* src/dfa.c: Include xalloc.h.
	(xmalloc, xrealloc, xcalloc): Remove.

	grep: cleanup one const cast
	* src/search.c (GEAcompile): Do not reuse motif when operating on the
	(const) pattern, so we can make it non-const.  Remove cast from free.

	kwset/system: remove ptr_t
	* src/kwset.h: Declare kwset using an incomplete struct type.
	* src/system.h (ptr_t): Remove.

2010-03-12  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	tests: add test cases for dfaexec bug
	* tests/dfaexec-multibyte: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Add it.
	Reported by Paolo Bonzini in http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544407
	and http://bugzilla.redhat.com/544406 .

	dfa: manually merge gawk's dfaexec
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Adjust API: return pointer, not offset, and
	take an "end" pointer parameter, rather than integral "size".
	Adjust comment accordingly.
	(build_state): Maintain d->newlines.
	(copytoks): Update multibyte_prop indices.
	(SKIP_REMAINS_MB_IF_INITIAL_STATE): Update a cast.
	Return NULL, rather than (size_t) -1.
	(realloc_trans_if_necessary): Realloc d->newlines.
	* src/dfa.h (struct dfa): New member, "newlines".
	(struct dfa) [GAWK]: New member, "broken".
	(dfaexec): Update prototype and copy the new comment from dfa.c.

	dfa: make search.c use the new dfaexec API

	* src/search.c: Adjust to new dfaexec API.
	Now, dfaexec returns a pointer, not an integer,
	and the third parameter is END, not buffer size.
	* src/dfa.c (dfaexec): Rewrite the function's comment.
	Don't just clobber *END.  While doing that happens to be
	fine for gawk's usage, in grep, *END usually points to the
	first byte of the next buffer.  Save the initial value,
	and restore it just before returning.
	* src/dfa.h (dfaexec): Update comment; include parameter names.

	dfa: appease static analyzers
	* src/dfa.c (transit_state_singlebyte): Call abort rather
	than returning in a "can't happen" scenario.

2010-03-11  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	dfa: do not accept [[:UPPER:]] or [[:LOWER:]] internally
	* src/dfa.c (parse_bracket_exp_mb): Those class names are not
	valid, and rejected elsewhere, so there is no point in allowing
	upper or mixed-case versions here.

	* src/search.c (EXECUTE_FCT): Remove trailing space.

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS
	Remove most with this:
	git grep -lw PARAMS |xargs perl -pi -e 's/\bPARAMS *\((.*)\);/$1;/'
	Remove the remainder manually.

	maint: remove all uses of PARAMS
	* lib/savedir.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions manually.

	* src/dfa.h (PARAMS): Remove definitions.
	* src/system.h (PARAMS): Likewise.

	maint: remove now-useless prototypes
	* src/dfa.c: Remove the prototype of each static, non-recursive
	function whose definition precedes first use.

	grep: plug an inconsequential leak
	* src/grep.c (main): Plug a leak: free "keys".

	grep: avoid useless allocations for empty GREP_OPTIONS
	* src/grep.c (prepend_default_options): Ignore GREP_OPTIONS
	when it's empty, not just when it's undefined.
	There are still relatively harmless leaks when GREP_OPTIONS
	is set and non-empty.  We'll address those, eventually.

2010-03-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: record build-from-clone tool requirements
	* bootstrap.conf (buildreq): This makes bootstrap fail with

	* doc/grep.texi: Likewise.

2010-03-05  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	maint: dfa-sync: comment and dead-to-grep code: no semantic change
	* src/dfa.c: Sync a comment and some #ifdef GAWK code.

	maint: dfa-sync: don't malloc zero
	* src/dfa.c (dfacomp): Skip case_fold logic when length is zero.

	convert AUTHORS file to UTF-8
	* AUTHORS: Convert to UTF-8.

	eliminate invalid "ptr += (ptr2 - ptr1)"
	* lib/savedir.c (savedir): new_name_space and name_space do not point into
	the same object, so computing their difference is invalid.  Similarly,
	summing the difference to namep is invalid because namep and the result
	point into different objects.  Avoid this.

	fix for bug 21276
	* lib/savedir.c (isdir1): Use realloc instead of calloc.  Remove
	dead code.
	(savedir): Do not leak name_space if allocation of new_name_space fails.

	build: avoid warnings in gnulib-supplied regex files
	Now that we enable more warnings in lib/, we choose
	to avoid some via patches applied by bootstrap, using
	files in the gl/ hierarchy.  Other, less-important
	warnings are avoided simply by turning off the
	-Wold-style-definition option and using a slightly
	relaxed set of warnings $(GNULIB_WARN_CFLAGS) in lib/.

	ok, since we know the input is a valid upper case wide character.
	(Fexecute, EGexecute): Update callers of check_multibyte_string
	to use both it and check_multibyte_string_no_icase.

	maint: avoid warnings about unused fwrite return value
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add unlocked-io.
	* src/system.h: Include "unlocked-io.h".

	maint: remove {m4,lib}/.gitignore; they were undergoing too much churn
